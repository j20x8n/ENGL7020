The Markedness Model and The Conversation-Analytic Approach to Code-switching
Instructions: Your answer should cover BOTH Part I and Part II.
Part I: Analyze the following conversation and the motivations of code-switching in terms of the Markedness Model. What may be some limitations of the Markedness Model with reference to this conversation? Is the CA approach more appropriate in analyzing this extract? Why or why not?
Context: Two friends living in the United States, Li and Wang are both immigrants from China and they usually speak Mandarin Chinese to each other. Wang’s car is out of order and he asks Li for help. Li used to be a mechanic in China. L does not offer real mechanic help but keeps giving advice and suggestions (W = Wang; L = Li).
Their speech data are marked below with line numbers on the left hand side, and in the brackets are a Chinese translation and an English translation.

Part II: Conduct an in-depth analysis of the following conversation in terms of Conversation Analysis. To what extent does code-switching mark important sequences (e.g. repair, repair initiation, dispreference, transition between pre-sequence and the key sequence, reformulation, topic shift, etc.)? What are some of the limitations of CA with reference to this particular conversation?
